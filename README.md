# Demo of LoRa (2019)

Simple demo Using four Microcontroller as nodes to send temperatures and humidity to a D1 Mini with a OLED for display.  

Using: 2 D1 mini (ESP8266), with custom 915mhz LoRa boards/shield, one is the display, one is using a SHT30 sensor, this is node1.  
2 Arduino UNOs with LinkSprite 915mhz LoRa shield, and DHT11 sensors. (Nodes 3 and 4)  
And one "dummy" node setup on a LoRa32u4 feather board, no temperature sensor - the values are random (Node 2).
